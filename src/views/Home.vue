        <p>Hey there 😁</p>
        <p> I'm Lemiil, a web developer. </p>
        <p>I've been doing this for quite a while and have a solid understanding of programming and the web in
            particular. </p>
        <p>I value elegance and simplicity in technology — after all, as Terry Davis once said, "An idiot admires
            complexity,
            a genius admires simplicity." </p>
        <p> That's exactly why the only modern tech used on this site is Vue. Everything else was handcrafted by me.
